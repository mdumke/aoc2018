# Advent of Code Challenge

Here are my attempts to solve the coding challenges from [adventofcode](https://adventofcode.com/2018).

Run scripts for each day from root directory via `node day-<xx>`. To run the testsuite, be sure to `npm install` before running `npm test`.


## Requirements

- NodeJS >= v9.4
